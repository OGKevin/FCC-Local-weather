##Show the Local Weather

A FCC project (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

As explained on the FCC website the user should be able to do the following:

* I can see the weather in my current location
* I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather
* I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius

Everything works as intended when run locally 

##Know Issues

* Temperature is not centered
* There is no way to know if you are viewing Celsius or Farenheit 
* Gitpages can't load some API's due to HTTP over HTTPS
